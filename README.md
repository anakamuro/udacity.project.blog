# udacity.project.blog
- That is the blog post for udacity project. I made two pages. I used a grid and made the websites to be responsive. 
+ I made the buttons with javascript. If the person pushed the button, the person can see the longer paragraphs. 
+ By clicking to Latest Posts and Go to HOMEPAGE letters, I let the user navigate from homepage to blog page and vice versa. 
+ And by clicking the buttons of six sites in Boston in archives, the users can see the picture and the article of the site. 
+ Inside the footer of the homepage, I put the author's personal information.
